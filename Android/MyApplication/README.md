# twilio-sms-android
A sample Android application that sends SMS messages via Twilio

To use this application you will need a backend which can be found in [this other repository](https://github.com/mplacona/twilio-sms-spark)

Also make sure you rename the file app/src/main/res/values/strings.example.xml to strings.xml and add the correct `backend_url` from the step above
